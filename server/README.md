# Satonomics - Server

## Description

A small server which automatically creates routes for all the created datasets

## Requirements

- `rustup`

## Run

```bash
# Install rustup
# Update ./run.sh if needed
./run.sh
```

Then the easiest to let others access your server is with `cloudflared` which will also cache requests.
